# check_list_revamp

It has the same idea with the Trello clone but it's not entirely the same thing.

I've updated the arrangement of code. Fix something to greatly reduce the cost of deploying the thing. Though, due to the nature of Blockchain, its readablity won't be very good. 

I need some advises about simple versatile multiple dimensional structure. I've beens spending two days just to design a proper structure for this idea, I couldn't come up with a proper thought. Windows device regedit have successfully created such structure so I think it's not impossible. Still quite hard though. 

The log recording function, it's surely convinient for users to track down who has done what. But it has a huge problem. That if we have too many functions that need to log event, it's like you double the contract's deploy fee. 

Initially, this contract cost ~ 0.03 ETH, now it has doubled up to ~ 0.07 ETH, which is quite significant. So, this ultility needs to be considered in the future.
