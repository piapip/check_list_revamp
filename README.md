CASE CLOSE:

Rule of thumb when coding in Blockchain: if you have to do anything between variables other than assigning values, you are doing something very wrong. DO NOT DO COMPLICATE CALCULATE IN BLOCKCHAIN. IT'S EXPENSIVE.  

I need some advises about simple versatile multiple dimensional structure. I've beens spending two days just to design a proper structure for this idea, I couldn't come up with a proper thought. Windows device regedit have successfully created such structure so I think it's not impossible. Still quite hard though. 

The log recording function, it's surely convenient for users to track down who has done what. But it has a huge problem. That if we have too many functions that need to log event, it's like you double the contract's deploy fee. Initially, this contract cost ~ 0.03 ETH, now it has doubled up to ~ 0.07 ETH, which is quite significant. So, this ultility needs to be considered in the future.

To reduce the cost of the project, frontend has to do a lot of work. The code is really either ugly or super long to read which is also super ugly. 

My design skill are showing flaws due to lack of experience. If only I had a partner working with me on this one.

Initial cost so far (could be a lot better I think): <br />
Deploy: ~0.07 ETH (~11.7607 USD) <br />
Every other action: ~0.003 - 0.005 ETH (50 cents - 84 cents) <br />

NEW OBJECTIVE: 
Learn how to integrate Blockchain and other database, for example: mongoDB, SQL. Blockchain is so expensive that the use of it should worth the cost. <br /> 
Blockchain properties: <br />
+ Security
+ Authoritative
- Speed
- Signature verification (So annoying to have to sign everything before to able to issue another command)
